 * Welcome to java tutorials
 * this is chapter 1 - Introduction
 * 
 * Java is a programming language used to instruct the computer on what to do.
 * a programming language is designed to be understandable by humans and are to
 * be translated to machine language which the machine can understand. This
 * conversion process are executed by the compiler (in this case, the java
 * compiler)
 * 
 * Java is the language used here
 * 
 * And oh btw, this is a comment. A comment is used for documentation within the
 * source file, this file is called the source file where the programming syntax
 * is written and then read by the compiler.
 * 
 * a comment is a way for people to easily read their code, when your code is
 * used for a very long time someday you or other programmer/s might need to
 * make some changes in the code, to make the process faster we employ comments
 * so that the future programmer don't have to read each and every line of code
 * in order to understand what the program is doing.
 * 
 * The comment is never executed by the compiler and is there only for humans.
 * You can write comments like the example below

/**
This is a
multi-line
comment

/*
This is also
a multi-line
comment
*/

// This is a single line comment

/*
Since this file consists of only comments, the compile has nothing to execute therefore
this program will output nothing and will also do nothing and therefore will not run.
