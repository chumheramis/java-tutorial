 * 
 * Welcome to Chapter 4 - Variables
 * 
 * Welcome back to Java tutorials! In this chapter i am going to teach you about
 * variables, a variable is like a bucket where you can store anything. A
 * variable will contain a value which is dynamic, in short variable's value
 * is always subject to change.
 * 
 * In java, C, C++  before you can use a variable, you need to declare it first.
 * The syntax/code for declaring variables is as follows
 * [data-type] [variable name] = [value];
 * 
 * TAKE NOTE OF THE EQUAL SIGN (=) AND THE SEMI-COLON (;) cuz you'll be using it.

        Below we declared a string variable named strVar with the value "This is
        a string" take note that when we declare the string's value we need to
        encapsolate it with double qoutation ["]
        
        A string is a series of characters, it could be a series of upper-case 
        letters, lower-case letters, numbers, special characters or a
        combination of all.

        the value of a char variable should be encapsulated with single
        qoutations (').
        
        The char type value is composed only with 1 character, it could be
        an upper-case, lower-case, number, or special character.

        Note again that

        char value require you to encapsulate it with single qoutation.

Congratulations! You have succesfully declared variables. Awesome!
