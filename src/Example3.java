As you can see the file name of this source file is Example3.java therefore
the class name of the program should also be Example3, just like what i said
in the previous chapter yeah? The logic is that simple.

    As I also mentioned in the previous chapter the main method will repeat itself
    alot, and there should be no reason that you will fail to memorize this.

        In this example we will have multiple lines of codes.
        A line of code is called a statement. so we will write multiple program
        statement here.

Congratulations! You have created a more advance java program!
Please do experiment with the values to understand more.
